# Summary
Wistia's javascript player api uses 'window' to process video onReady events. This causes onReady to be called multiple times when the controller view is revisited. Looking for help on how to make the onReady event 'angular friendly'.

# Get Started

Use node v4.x

npm install -g cordova ionic
npm install
ionic serve
